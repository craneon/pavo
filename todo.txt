## Stuff to do
- add ability to use `explorespec` with factors
- make better labeling of spectra in `type=stack`, giver user control for labeling
- bug fix
- add ability to set limits in `summary` and other functions
- return warnings in `peakshape` if (1) one of the peak boundaries is at either 300 or 700 nm, (2) the ratio of the two halves of the peak is >>1; also, it would be nice to be able to specify unique boundaries in this case.. (how??)
- maybe `peakshape` can be interactive? i.e., plot it out, wait for user input (click, fix bounds, etc.), then record the data in an output dataset
- add couple plotting options for `segclass` objects
- add ability to use RegExp subsetting within plot.rspec() (e.g., plot(specs, subset="Duck1"))
- fix getspec() to give reasonable output when provided wl limits are outside those the wls in the data

## Me
- Add CIE chromaticity diagram function
+ Make fast `getspec` function
- make `lines.rspec`
- add ability to produce static 3d plots (scatter3d, add points, add volumes)
- add ability to produce heatmap plot with `varying` vector in non-ascending order
+ add ability to add arguments to `aggspec` (e.g., `na.rm=TRUE`)
- need to make default color for points (it's transp now)
+ add ability to set `alpha` in `spec2rgb`
- give few options to calculate rgb values from specs (normalize, don't normalize)?
+ `subset.rspec` isn't working right. fix it so that 'wl' column is removed prior to subsetting.

## Raf
+ deprecate tcs class, have general `colspace` class
+ don't load `rgl` automatically
- add dichromatic chromaticity diagrams
- add hexagon chromaticity diagram
