## Dichromatism Measurement: Patch-by-patch volume centroid distance

## Measures distance between the centers of the convex hulls created by the set of spectra for each male and female patch.

## Adds together the patch-by-patch distances for total color distance and divides by number of patches. 

## If you are using additional patches beyond a standard set, make sure your results are correlated strongly with those procured with only your standard set (e.g. if you have 9 patches for some birds and a standard set of 5, you want to make sure that the additional 4 patches are not skewing the final measurement after averaging). 

## MUST be in the "Specs-by-Species" working directory, produced by the species.spec() function.

	## If the loop produces errors and stops, type x to see the name of the species at which the error occurred. 
	## The most likely cause of error is insufficient data: the centroid distance calculation requires at least 4 measurements per patch per sex (e.g. four female throats), which can come from multiple individuals. 
	## If you only have one individual of a species, measure at least 5 spectra per patch.
